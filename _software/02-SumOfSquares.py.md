Sum of squares modelling language built on top of
[picos](https://picos-api.gitlab.io/picos/). In addition to modelling convex
relaxations of polynomial optimization problems, this package also provides easy
access to pseudoexpectation operators for both formulating problems and
extracting solutions via rounding algorithms.
