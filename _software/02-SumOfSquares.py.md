Sum of squares optimization built on top of the modeling language
[picos](https://picos-api.gitlab.io/picos/). In addition to modeling convex
relaxations of polynomial optimization problems, this package also provides easy
access to pseudoexpectation operators for both formulating problems and
extracting solutions via rounding algorithms.
