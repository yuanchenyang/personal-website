A lightweight diffusion library for training and sampling from diffusion
models. It is built for easy experimentation when training new models and
developing new samplers, supporting minimal toy models to state-of-the-art
pretrained models. The core of this library for diffusion training and sampling
is implemented in less than 100 lines of very readable pytorch code.
