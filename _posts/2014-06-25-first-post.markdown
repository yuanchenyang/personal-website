I've finally found the time to start a blog! I think the last time I've tried to
blog was more than 8 years ago...

I've decided to build this mostly from scratch, using [Jekyll][jekyll] as a
static blog generator. It's not entirely from scratch as I'm also using a
modified version of the [Kasper][kasper] theme. The source of this blog can be
found on [github][blog-gh].

What I like about Jekyll is that it's really easy to blog in Markdown, and
generate everything with:

{% highlight console %}
$ jekyll build
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, there's syntax highlighting and even \\(\LaTeX\\) support.

In the next few weeks, I'm going to try to blog about something interesting
(Physics/Math/CS) at least once a week.
