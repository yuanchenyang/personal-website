Sum of squares relaxation is a powerful paradigm for solving polynomial
optimization problems. This tutorial covers the numerical and computational
aspects of solving sum of squares problems with a number example problems. Code
examples for solving these problems are provided using the respective software
packages in the Macaulay, Matlab, Julia and Python languages.
