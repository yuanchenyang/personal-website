When reading papers in the browser, I find it helpful to be able to click on
references and look at the referenced text in a pop-up window. This hack on
[pdf.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/) implements this functionality. It is
also available as a [chrome
extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pdf-popup-link-viewer/ognpkkhmcllgbedbdjlckiagncpphmgc). [\[Demo\]](https://pdf.chenyang.co/web/viewer.html?file=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.0621.pdf)
