A tool for saving Facebook groups in a local database and doing comprehensive
searches locally. After the first download, it will sync the local database with
the Facebook group during each run. This also includes a web-interface for
stats, searching and running database queries with nicely formatted
results. Note: the archiver does not work as of early 2018 after Facebook
restricted their groups API. Only the visualizer works when viewing
already-archived groups.
