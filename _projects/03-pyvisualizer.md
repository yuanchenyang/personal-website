An online tool that run python programs and visualize the code branching using
[D3.js](https://d3js.org/). The programs are run in a sandbox in
the server while being profiled, and the branch information is then sent to the
client and rendered. From the rendered diagram we can see which lines of the
code is hit the most, and also color-coded lines to indicate the direction of
control-flow. Created at Facebook's Battle of the Bay hackathon 2013.
