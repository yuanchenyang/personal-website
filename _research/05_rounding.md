This line of work studies convex relaxations of functions of the form $$f(x^T
A_1 x, \ldots, x^T A_d x)$$. For very high degree but structured polynomials we
derive intermediate relaxations interpolating between spectral and
Sum-of-Squares relaxations, as well as randomized rounding schemes (see picture
on the right). We also analyze rounding schemes for different functions $$f$$,
making a connection to Max-Cut.
