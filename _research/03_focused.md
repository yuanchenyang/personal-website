title: Focused Polynomials
---

Masters thesis work on characterizing classes of polynomial optimization
problems on the sphere that can be compressed by a random projection. Introduced
the notion of polynomials generated from focused cones, and the reduced
dimension depends on the Gaussian width of the focused cones.
