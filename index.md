I am a research scientist at the [Toyota Reseach
Institute](https://www.tri.global/). I completed my PhD in 2022 at the
[Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems
(LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} and the [Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science (EECS)](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"}
department at MIT, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Pablo
Parrilo](https://www.mit.edu/~parrilo){:target="_blank"}. Before coming to MIT,
I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A in Computer Science.

Outside of work, my hobbies include participating in [puzzle
hunts](https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/){:target="_blank"}, [rock
climbing](/climbing.html) and other outdoor activities.
