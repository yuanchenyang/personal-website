Currently a PhD student in the [Laboratory of Information and Decision Systems
(LIDS)](https://lids.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"} and the [Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science (EECS)](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/){:target="_blank"}
department at MIT. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Pablo
Parrilo](https://www.mit.edu/~parrilo){:target="_blank"}. Before coming to MIT,
I graduated from UC Berkeley with a B.A in Computer Science.

Outside of work, my hobbies include participating in [puzzle
hunts](https://www.mit.edu/~puzzle/){:target="_blank"}, rock climbing (indoors
and
[outdoors](https://www.mountainproject.com/user/201277033/chenyang-yuan){:target="_blank"})
and outdoor activities.
