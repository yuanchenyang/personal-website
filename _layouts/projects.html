      This is an set of Javascript-based interpreters which use web-workers. It
      differs from other Javascript interpreters as the main interpreting work
      is done in a seperate worker thread, and thus would not slow down the main
      UI thread when performing a lengthy computation. There is a front-end
      providing the input and output prompts, which links to many separate
      interpreter backends. Currently the main backend is a Scheme interpreter,
      which implements a significant subset of Scheme. There is also a logic
      interpreter which is based on a subset of Prolog taught in CS61A at
      Berkeley, and a Javascript interpreter which just calls <code>eval</code>.

        <h3> Facebook Group Archiver </h3>
      </a>
      A tool for saving Facebook groups in a local database and doing
      comprehensive searches locally. After the first download, it will sync the
      local database with the Facebook group during each run. This also includes
      a web-interface for stats, searching and running database queries with
      nicely formatted results.

        <h3> 3D Particle Simulation </h3>
      </a>
      A simulation with thousands of particles attracted by gravity towards many
      sources. Particles are shaded based on their speed, with red the fastest
      and white the slowest. The gravity is simulated numerically with
      the <a class="project-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods">

      method ran in the CPU, whereas the rendering and the shading is done in
      the GPU using WebGL and the three.js library.

        <h3> Python Control Flow Visualization </h3>
      </a>
      An online tool that run python programs and visualize the code branching
      using D3.js. The programs are run in a sandbox in the server while being
      profiled, and the branch information is then sent to the client and
      rendered. From the rendered diagram we can see which lines of the code is
      hit the most, and also color-coded lines to indicate the direction of
      control-flow.

      A Scheme interpreter from scratch that runs on my TI-89 graphing
      calculator. It is written in C and supports a small subset of the Scheme
      language.

      </a>
      Used Python to create a logic gate simulation system with constraint
      passing. This system also allows powerful abstractions to be made so that
      more complicated sets of gates can be created, saved and reused.
